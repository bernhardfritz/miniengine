# @miniengine/glm

Partial reimplementation of the popular C++ Open**GL M**athematics library in TypeScript.

`@miniengine/glm` provides types and functions designed and implemented with the same naming conventions and functionality than GLSL so that anyone who knows GLSL, can use `@miniengine/glm` as well in TypeScript.
